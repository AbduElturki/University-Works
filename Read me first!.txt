This where I upload my finished assignments for my University.

There are 3 folders, C, Haskell, and Algorithm.

C folder includes assignments for C language, it also includes file named "Task Assignment", where it explains the aim of the task, the readme.txt in each assignment folder explains
how extension.c code works.

Haskell folder is for Haskell language, it includes "Task Assignment" files as well, readme.lhs and readme.pdf. both readme files are the same, the pdf was created by using pandoc.

Algorithm folder include .txt files which are answers for the assignment questions. The questions are available here https://github.com/conorhoughton/COMS10002/tree/master/2015_16/worksheets 
If I have obatained any feedbacks from the lecturer, I will include it in this folder.
