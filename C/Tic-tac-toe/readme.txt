This my extension, which is text based game of Witcher 3.
The reason I have chosen to make text based version of Witcher 3, because of its
dialogue and flexibility of this game where you can do numerous of different
quest in any order yo would like, and how dialogue choices can effect the game.


The game has a battle system, which is luck based. Before every fight you get
to choose which Sword you would like to use (Silver or Steel). Choosing the
correct type of sword will make the fight much easier. There is a hidden
surprise, if you input invalid choice you get to use only your fists, which is
not fun.

Type of enemies, chance of succeeding of avoid their attack, and their HP.
Ghoul HP: 18, Chance of avoiding their attack 60%. Weapon to be used: Silver.
Bandit HP: 18, Chance of avoiding their attack 60%. Weapon to be used: Steel.
Drowners HP: 27, Chance of avoiding their attack 50%. Weapon to be used: Silver.
Wild Dogs HP: 6 Chance of avoiding their attack 75%. Weapon to be used: Silver.

Silver sword does 6 HP damage on Monsters, 3 HP on Bandit, and 2 HP on Dogs.
Steel Sword does 6 HP damage on Bandit, 3 on Dogs and Monsters.
Using fists only does 1 HP damage to any opponent.



If a player chooses invalid choice for dialog and such, the game will prevent it
and it will ask for a valid choice.

Some certain dialogs can unlock some other hidden dialog in the game, however it
doesn't cause anything major in the game. However, I have included "funny" hidden
text in the game.

You can do certain tasks in any order you would like, you will encounter it in
the Inn or after visiting the garrison Commander.

When traveling to a different area, you are most likely to fight a monster,
%10 chance you won't fight any.


Improvements that I didn't have enough time to add/change:
1. Money and Shops, to buy potions to restore HP.
2. change to all "scanf" to a better functions.
3. change how Press [Enter] to continue it works, I'm not satisfied how it works.
   I could have easily made it into a function...


I hope you will enjoy the game.
