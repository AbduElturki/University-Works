The aims are to practice essential bit manipulation skills, and to read binary
files. Also, you will get to work on a multi-module program (though you only
have to develop one module) and you get to see a graphics library being used
(though you don't have to write any graphics code explicitly yourself).

In this assignment, you are going to be very strongly encouraged to develop by
writing very small functions. If you don't, and you just put everything into one
big monolithic function, there is no way you will be able to reach the end of the
assignment (except perhaps by extreme luck or heroism). On the other hand, if you
keep your functions very small, you may find the development surprisingly smooth
and rewarding.

The challenge is to develop a program sketch.c which reads in a file in a custom
binary format (a .sketch file). The file contains graphics instructions which
represent a recording of a sketch, including timings. The program translates
the instructions into calls to a graphics module, which is provided.
