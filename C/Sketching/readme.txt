Extension:

I have made very simple program, which I have learnt a lot from. I was able to
make a new window, and I can choose it location of its appearance, and the size
of it. Also, how to make the window where the user is able to close it. and
finally, display a *.bmp imange.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

As for the actual assignment: I have learnt how to separate certain values of
bits. e.g. first 2, and last 6. Read, byte/bits of files. Using pointers to use
a value in one function to a different function, e.g. move function. I have also
learnt how to deal with extended operands.
