1) The program passed the test. However, since there is an extension added to
the program, the test programs are no longer compatible with it.

2) The extension allows the program to run forward by given ticks. However, it
doesn't cope with cells outgrowing the original rectangle.

3) I have evolve function from this code http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life/C
I have reproduce it to work with Dr. Ian's print and read functions.

4) I rate myself as competent.
