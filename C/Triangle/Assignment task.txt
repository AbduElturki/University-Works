The program takes its input from the command line, and prints its output on the
standard output, e.g.

./triangle 3 4 5
Equilateral
The possible responses are:

Equilateral     (all sides equal)
Isosceles       (two sides equal)
Right           (has a right angle)
Scalene         (sides unequal, but no right angle)
Flat            (no area)
Impossible      (lengths don't add up)
Illegal         (lengths are invalid)


The program includes 50 auto-tests, of which 49 are currently commented out.
If the program is run with no command line arguments, it runs the tests and
prints the number of tests passed. That number is your mark for the first part
of the assignment.

Your aim is to make the program work with all the tests uncommented. You should
change the content of the triangle function, and add further functions above it
as you think fit. You shouldn't change the overall design, because we will test
your triangle function directly from the outside for marking purposes.
